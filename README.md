# Swapi Character Searcher

Search for your favorite Star Wars character and get cool details about them. Built using React and swapi.dev

Currently, the app lets you search for characters by name, and shows you information such as their species, their homeworld (name and population), and which films they appeared in (sorted by descending order).
